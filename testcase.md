#Test Case Document
This document outlines various scenarios to test in the React Native app. The test cases cover different functionalities and features of the app. The tests include both unit tests using the Jest testing framework and manual testing.

##Test Scenarios
###User Interface

Verify that all the screens are displayed correctly with the expected layout and design.
Test the responsiveness of the UI across different device screen sizes and orientations.
Ensure that all buttons, inputs, and interactive elements are functional and responsive.
###Navigation

Test the navigation between different screens within the app.
Verify that navigating back to the previous screen works correctly.
Test navigation to specific screens through buttons, links, or gestures.
###Input Validation

Test input validation for forms and user inputs.
Ensure that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.
Verify that the app prevents submitting forms with invalid or incomplete data.
###Data Rendering

Test the rendering of data fetched from APIs or local storage.
Verify that the data is displayed correctly in the UI components.
Test different data scenarios, such as empty data, large datasets, or special characters.
###User Interactions

Test the functionality of interactive elements like buttons, dropdowns, sliders, etc.
Verify that user interactions trigger the expected actions or state changes.
Test edge cases, such as long press, double click, or rapid input.
Error Handling

Test the app's behavior when encountering errors, timeouts, or network issues.
Verify that appropriate error messages or fallback options are displayed.
Test error recovery scenarios, such as retrying API requests or reconnecting to a network.
###Integration Testing

Test the integration between different components and modules of the app.
Verify that data flows correctly between components and triggers the expected behavior.
Test different combinations and scenarios to ensure seamless integration.
Unit Testing with Jest
For each of the test scenarios above, write and execute unit test cases using the Jest testing framework. Ensure proper setup and configuration of Jest in the project. The unit tests should cover the different functions, components, and utilities used in the app and verify their behavior.

###Manual Testing and Bug Fixes
Perform manual testing of the app to identify any bugs or issues that were not caught by the unit tests. Create a document to record the identified bugs along with steps to reproduce and any additional details. Fix the identified bugs and issues based on the findings from manual testing.

During manual testing, pay attention to usability, user experience, and any unexpected behaviors. Test the app on different devices, operating systems, and screen resolutions to ensure compatibility.

Document the bugs that were found and fixed, along with the steps taken to resolve them. Also, note any personal experiences and challenges faced during the frontend development and testing process.
