# Personal Experience:
### (Our Experience in the Development Process of AutoHub)

* Developing this app made us familiar with react native and its advantages over other mobile application development softwares.
* Furthermore, we learned more about how important preplanning and analysis of the application is before we move on to coding it.
* The low-fidelity prototype helped us to understand how we can easily position components in our app and later make it interactive for a better user experience with the high-fidelity section.
* We learned how React Native relies on JavaScript and how we need to strengthen our JS skills in order to keep the work flow smooth.
* The advantages of how components and modules help in making a reuseable code.
* We had fun exploring different APIs and integrating them in our application and understand how the apps we use in our daily life are making use of these APIs
* We learned how to attach packages and use React Native Debugger and Expo to test and debug our code easily without having the trouble of debugging it manually which is very time consuming and delays the development period.
* Lastly we understood how apps are deployed on playstore and app store but we that was one of the sections we just went through out of curiosity.




# Challenges:
### (Challenges we Faced in the Development Process of AutoHub)

* Firstly, we had to learn how we can make our app cross-platform using React Native
* Making our app interactive such as adding location services and image sliders etc
* Keeping our app simple so that even a layman can understand it easily and use it
* Adding unique features which are not available in apps of the same so that more users are attracted to it
* Displaying our app and specifying generalized sizes of props/components so that it can be easily within a device's safe view area.
* Keeping our app's user and catalogs data upto date with Firebase.
* Linking firebase to our app and specifying navigation using expo router.
